Hi evereyone!

//TODO: Introduce what this talk is about

It is an honour to be attending the first Gleam Gathering ever, and I am excited to see how this evolves in the years to come.

Let's do a quick introduction first: I'm John Lindbakk. I have been working as
a developer, architect and tech lead for over a decade at this point. Any my
job has primarily been within big enterprise codebases. You know the ones:
- Banking
- Insurance
- Healthcare
Often working with systems with so many integrations that we barely know what
does owned by a team in a different country, belonging to a completely different
department which we don't know what does. And often there's a very strict "architectre board"
which decides the exact technologies we should be using, while there are ivory tower architects
that defines everything (and then blame everyone else when things go wrong).

In other words, I've lived in a world which is very formal, rigid and top-down.
And I think that is an interesting perspective to have when talking about Gleam.

Another thing about me is that I grew up here, called Lunde in Telemark, in Norway:

Telemark is said to be "Norway within Norway" due to its nature and history.

This is where I have my family, and now that I have 3 kids I really want
them to have a good relationship with my family. The thing is, I got this
bad boy:

and my mum has this beast:

Neither really having the capacity to easily let one visit each other.
No worries though, because as one of the richest countries in the world,
we have public transportation! We got train! See this randy line
right here:

It goes exactly where I need it to go! Isn't that great?

So, why am I telling you this? Well, the reason is that this is just theory.
In practice the train is often so delayed that it is not worth taking it. Often
I'd spend less time taking my Renault Zoe without fast charging. As a result
it has reduced how much my children get to spend with their extended family.

It was this summer I sat on the train from a visit, and as it tends to be
I was 3 hours delayed. So I grabbed my laptop and started rage-coding, which became
Surtoget.
