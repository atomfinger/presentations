Hi evreyone, and thanks for having me! I'm John and I actually graduate from
Aber uni in 2023, and have since worked as a developer, architect, subject manager
and tech lead.

## AI is part of the future. It is not _THE_ future

Let me open this with what seems like a controversial opinion: None of you
should be using LLM/AI. It simply isn't for you, and you're not ready for it.

I know I know, it is a "hot take", but hear me out and hopefully I can convince
a few of you.

When working with code you constantly learn, even when you think you don't. If
you're doing something that is tidious, then you learn that doing that is annoying
and you migth go out and search for ways to make it less annoying. Here you'll
either find a way to do something, or you learn why it is the way it is, or you
figure out that the underlying design of your code being the issue.

This is the core learning loop: Find something that bothers you with the current apporach,
looking into it and come up with a solution, be it new design, tools, or just a
deeper understanding of the it.

This is how we grow as developers, especially early on. 

When we introduce AI we interrup the learning loop. An AI won't really critique
the design. It'll just generate a way around it. An AI won't have the feeling
of something being wrong and looking closer into it. And even if it did, it wouldn't
bring you along on the search for a better solution. It will just present a couple
of suggestions, but that's about it.

This means less learning for you. In most cases it will just ignore issues and
just generate the solutions. Which means you don't get the experience that
one would get from solving these problems. And you won't get the learning
from going down the wrong path and making mistakes. 

You also miss the accidental discoveries by exploring stuff that might now solve
your current problem, but that might be useful in the future.

One might think that this learning doesn't matter, but it really does. AI are 
statistical programs that tries to predict: Nothing more. They play off your
experience level, and the lower that experience level is, the less able you 
will be to challenge, or see problems with the, decisions made by the AI.

For a number of years now I've held interviews for the companies I've worked with.
Me and my peers has seen a drastic drop in knowledge and skills in new graduates since 
LLMs became wildly available. 

AI doesn't replace experience, nor the ability to code. Don't do your career a disservice:
learn to code without AI. Yes, I know, it is harder. It can be really annoying, especially 
knowing that the solution can be just a prompt away, but it is a long-term investment.

The counter argument to this is that we won't need to code in the long-term. I think this is
BS. There's no evidence for that claim.
//JUSTIFY CLAIM

TODO: FIGURE OUT HOW TO COMMUNICATE WHY LEARNING IS IMPORTANT WITHOUT HAVING 
TO GO INTO A TECHNICAL DEBT RANT!!!

## Technical debt

I disagree. "Working" is the lowest acceptable bar for a developer. It is
not good enough that it works, it needs to be good as well. If you speak
to business leaders and whatnot, they will say that results is what
matters, but that is because that is their responsibility area. They 
are supposed to care about results, and drive the business and its employees
towards results.

"Impact" and "results" is something developers impact, but those are not 
their sole responsibilities. They are also responsible for creating a 
healthy codebase that can survive changes as the business changes. They
are responsible for creating a stable product that doesn't blow up every
other week.

In other words, developers are responsible for technical debt. This is
not a management concern, it is a developer responsibility. When you go
out in the industry, it is your responsibility to handle technical debt.
Business leaders should not tell you that you need to reduce debt. You
should just be doing it.

This is something that a lot of developers miss, even very experienced ones.
